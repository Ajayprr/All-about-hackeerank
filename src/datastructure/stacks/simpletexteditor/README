In this problem, your task is to implement a simple text editor. Initially, a file contains an empty string SS. Your task is to perform QQ operations consisting of the following 44 types:

append(W)(W) - Appends the string WW at the end of SS.
erase(k)(k) - Erase the last kk character of SS.
get(k)(k) - Returns the kthkth character of SS.
undo()() - Undo the last not previously undone operation of type 11 or 22, so it reverts SS to the state before that operation.
Constraints

1≤Q≤1051≤Q≤105
1≤k≤|S|1≤k≤|S|

The sum of the lengths of all WW in the input ≤106≤106.
All input characters are lowercase English letters.
It is guaranteed that the sequence of input operation is possible to perform.

Input Format

The first line contains QQ, the number of operations.
Each of the following QQ lines contains a single integer tt, denoting the type of operation listed in the problem statement. Then, tt is followed by the argument of the operation, if it has any, separated by a space.

For example, if t=1t=1 then a single string WW follows. If t=2t=2 or 33, a single integer kk follows.

Output Format

For each operation of type 33, print a single line with the returned character of that operation.

Sample Input

9
1 abc
3 3
2 3
1 xy
3 2
4
4
3 1
Sample Output

c
y
a
Explanation

There are 99 operations. Initially, SS is empty.
In the first operation, we append abcabc to SS.
Then, we print its 3rd3rd character, which is cc at this point.
Next, we erase its last 33 characters, abcabc.
After that, we append xyxy to SS.
SS becomes xyxy after these previous two modifications.
Then, we are asked to return the 2nd2nd character of SS, which is yy.
After that, we have to undo the last update to SS, so SS becomes empty.
The next operation asks us to undo the update before that, so SS becomes abcabc again.
Finally, we are asked to print its 1st1st character, which is aa at this point.
